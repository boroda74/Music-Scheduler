# Music Scheduler

Plugin allows to schedule playback of static playlists, autoplaylists or Auto-DJ. It also can wake up PC to start playback.

*NOTE 1:*

Disable requirement to unlock Windows on PC wake-up. 

*NOTE 2:*

Active music task will be started immediately, when you manually run MusicBee, if the checkbox in column ">" to the left of "Start time" column for the first playlist in the task is unchecked. 

*NOTE 3:*

Plugin has options to prevent PC and monitor from sleeping if MusicBee is playing music. It doesn't matter if playback is started by plugin or manually. The only requirement for the options to take effect is that the plugin must be installed and enabled.
